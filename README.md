# webServer - on embedded STM NUCLEO-H723ZG
## C / C++ 20, FreeRTOS, LwIP, ptools

### Based on original example code from STM 
[github.com/STM.../LwIP/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Netconn_RTOS](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/tree/master/Projects/NUCLEO-H723ZG/Applications/LwIP/LwIP_HTTP_Server_Netconn_RTOS)

Original example shows 2 STM pages - 1st static board info and 2nd dynamic page showing RTOS threads

Modified code h7webserver shows same pages + some more. <br/> 
STM pages are generated by C code, interactive pages are from C++20 ptools at [github.com/okl-tools/ptools](https://github.com/okl-tools/ptools) .<br/>
This picture shows C++ app page on mobile controlling 2 LEDs on NUCLEO board

Bringing modern C++20 to bare metal or RTOS-based embedded systems is challenging.
ptools' aim is make a bridge between raw C power and modern C++.
STL is not designed to work on small devices. But there are many good things like
std::string, std::map, std::vector, ... we don't really want to miss.
Specially if you come from C++ desktop/frontend/backend developing to embedded world.

**ptools** is a like STL-light ... or better like STL-light-light

- PString //  std::string and a little like QString 
- P* templates
  - PMap // std::map
  - PArray // std::vector .... // I prefer array instead of vector because of 2D/3D vectors i often use...
  - PStack
  - PTokenizer
